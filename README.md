# Basic command structure
```s
command -options arguments
```

### Important commands
#### Manual command
* man
  * Read the manual page of a command
    ```s
    man ncal
    ```
  * Search a command
    ```s
    man -k <command_name>
    man -k passwd
    ```
  * Read the mannual page of a command in a specific session
    ```s
    man 1 passwd
    ```
  * Not all commands have commands entries. Some commands that are build in shell do not have manual information and you can use ***help*** command. 
    ```s
    help cd
    ```
#### Navigation commands
* pwd
  * Print the working directory
* ls
  * List the contents of a directory
  * List the contents of the current working directory:
    ```s
    ls
    ```
  * List the contents of a specific folder
    ```s
    ls <folder_dir>
    ls ~
    ```
  * List the contents of a directory with long format
    ```s
    ls -l
    ls -l <folder_dir>
    ```
  * List all the contents of a directory including hiding fils and folders
    ```s
    ls -a
    ls -a <folder_dir>
    ```
  * List **all** the contents of a directory with **long** format
    ```s
    ls -la
    ls -la <folder_dir>
    ```
  * List **all** the contents of a directory with **long** **human-readable** format
    ```s
    ls -lah
    ```
  * Lists the contents of a directory and **sorted** by size
    ```s
    ls -s
    ls --sort=time     // sort by time
    ```
* cd
  * Change the directory
    ```s
    cd folder_dir
    cd ..  // go to the parent directory
    cd ~   // go to user HOME directory
    cd /   // go to the root directory
    cd -   // go to the previous directory
    ```
  * **A single dot (.)**: the reference to the current diretory
  * **Double dots (..)**: are the reference to the parent directory
  * **/**: the root directory
  * **~**: the user HOME directory
  * Overview of the directories in linux:
    * **/bin**: "bin" is short for "binary directory". This directory contains lots of exectable programs.
    * **/etc**: contains configration (setting) files and initialization scripts.
    * **/media**: accesses the contents of the removable media, such as usb drive and sd card.
    * **/var**: "var" is short for "varaible". This directory contains files related with logging, the outputs from other programs, and caches.
    * **/root**: is the home directory of the super user (root user), which is different from "/".
    * **/usr**: contains exectable files, libraies. If you install a software, it will be most likely in this folder.

#### Creating files and folders
* touch
  * Change file timestamps (the original intended user of **touch** ^0^)
  * Create a **new** file or mutiple **new** files **if not exist**
    ```s
    touch <file_path_and_file_name>
    touch <file_name_1> <file_name_2> // creating multiple files in the current directory
    ```
  * You can create a new file in a specified directory as well:
    ```s
    touch ~/abc.txt  // create a new file named abc.txt in the HOME directory
    ```
* mkdir
  * Create new directories
    ```s
    mkdir <file_name>
    mkdir <file_name_1> <file_name_2>
    mkdir <file_path_and_file_name>
    ```
  * If you want to make mutiple nested directoris, you can use ***-p*** option.
    ```s
    // this command will show ERROR if animals or cats directory is not available
    mkdir animals/cats/small_cats

    // this command will create all three directories even if 
    // animals and cats directories are not available
    mkdir -p animals/cats/small_cats 
    ```
#### Deleting, copying, and moving
* rm
  * Remove files and directories from our machine
  * Remove files. The deleted file cannot be redo and **cannot be found from the trash can**.
    ```s
    rm <file_name>
    ```
  * Remove **empty** directories.
    ```s
    rm -d <empty_directories>
    rm --dir <empty_directories>
    rmdir <empty_directories>
    ```
  * Remove directories and their contents recursively.
    ```s
    rm -r <directories> // be careful when you run this command
    rm -R <directories> // be careful when you run this command
    rm -ri <directories> // remove the file and directories interatively
    ```
  * 
* mv
  * Move files and directories from one location to another location
    ```s
    mv <source> <destination> // destination directory is exist
    mv <source_1> <source_2> <destination> // destination directory is exist
    ```
  * Rename **a single** file or **a single** dirctory
    ```s
    mv <original_name> <new_name> 
    mv <original_dir_and_name> <new_dir_and_name> 
    ```
* cp
  * Copy files and directoris
    ```s
    cp <source> <destination>
    cp <file_name> <new_file_name>
    cp <source_1> <source_2> <destination_dir>
    cp -r <dir_name> <destination_dir> // use -r to copy directory recursively

    head -n 5 <file_name> // set how many lines to print out
    head -n5 <file_name> // set how many lines to print out
    head --lines 5 <file_name> // set how many lines to print out
    head -5 <file_name> // set how many lines to print out
    ```
* tail

  * You can use "Ctrl + r" to search history
  * History commands are saved in "~/.bash_history", so you can find all the history commands using `nano ~/.bash_history`.
* nano
  * nano is a program that we can use to open and edit files from the commandline
    ```s
    nano <file_path_and_file_name>
    ```
  * short cuts:
    * Shortcuts are written as follows: **Control-key** sequences are notated with a **'^'** and can be entered either by using the Ctrl key or pressing the Esc key twice.  **Meta-key** sequences are notated with **'M-'** and can be entered using either the **Alt, Cmd, or Esc** key, depending on your keyboard setup.
    * **Crtl + o (^O)**: write out the file and the nano will ask which file will be write to
    * **Ctrl + x**: exit/close
    * **Ctrl + s**: save the file changes
    * **Ctrl + c**: cancel

    * **Alt + u (M-U)**: undo
    * **Alt + e**: redo
    * **Alt + s**: Soft wrapping of overlong lines enable/disable
  * we can use nano to **create a new file** as well. We can type nano and follow a file name that does not exists.
    ```s
    nano <file_name_that_to_be_created>
    ```
* type
  * Tells the types of command
    ```s
    type <command_name>
